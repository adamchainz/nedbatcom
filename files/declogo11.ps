%      DIGITAL INTERNAL USE ONLY
%
% INTRODUCTION:
% This rendition of the Digital logo was prepared by Ned Batchelder using
% Adobe Illustrator and hand manipulation of the resulting PostScript code.
% Photographic masters of the logo were obtained from David Comberg in the
% Graphic Design Group. Additional consultation was provided by Elliot
% Hendrickson, one of the original designers of the logo.
%
% USE:
% This file defines a new PostScript font, called /DigitalLogo. It consists
% of three characters. (d) is the entire Digital logo, (t) is a small
% trademark symbol, and (T) is a large trademark symbol. The font is designed
% so that the argument to scalefont is the height of the logo. There is no
% extra white space around the logo at all. The trademarks are designed to be
% shown right after the logo, and they align themselves. The only correct
% strings to show with this font are (d), (dt), and (dT). There is an entry
% (named GapWidth) in the font dictionary which gives the unscaled width of
% the gap between the blocks. This distance is given because it is used as a
% unit to determine how much space to leave around the logo.
%
% HISTORY:
% The logo was designed in 1957 by Elliot Hendrickson, who was then working
% as an independent designer. He was contracted by DEC to do a brochure, and
% DEC wanted a logo to accompany it. The logo up to then had been the letters
% DEC in blocks the shape of the plug-in cards that DEC had been producing.
% Elliot re-worked the logo, incorporating letters which were hand-drawn for
% the purpose by Arthur Hover(?). The logo has been maintained since then in
% conventional technology, ie, film masters. There was at least one reworking
% of the logo at some point.
%
% The masters I received had a number of interesting features. The boxes were
% not all the same width, and there seemed to be no logic to which boxes were
% wider. The 'g' was the narrowest, and the 'i' and 'l' were second widest.
% Also, the two 'i's were not exactly the same shape. On ten-inch masters,
% (one box to an 8½x11 sheet), the boxes were not rectangles, but were very
% slightly tapered in wierd ways. I assume that the tapering is the result of
% too many reproductions, but the difference in widths may have been
% deliberate at some time. Elliot reports that when he drew it, all boxes
% were the same width. I have retained the different widths in my version,
% since the experts I had at hand did not seem to think I should make them
% uniform.
%
% Please feel free to use this logo, but keep in mind the following:
%
% 1. This code is for INTERNAL USE ONLY.
% 2. I am not entirely happy with the final shapes of the letters, and am
% hoping to improve them. Please allow for future updates to this code.
% 3. Only use this logo within the guidelines of the Corporate Identity
% program. If you use this font precisely as is, you can't get in much
% trouble. Don't take the shapes and do strange things with them.
% In particular, the Identity states that the logo is a one-color logo: The
% letters are actually holes in the blocks, through which the background can
% be seen. Do not modify this code so that the letters are always white.
