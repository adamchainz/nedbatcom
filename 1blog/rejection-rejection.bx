<p>John Kador has written a <a href='http://www.jkador.com/letter.htm'>rejection letter</a>
for rejection letters:</p>

<quotep>
Despite your companyâ€™s outstanding qualifications and previous experience in rejecting applicants,
I find that your rejection does not meet with my requirements at this time.
As a result, I will be starting employment with your firm on the first of the month.
