<title>Transcripts of talks?</title>
<category>presentations</category>
<body>

    <p>A friend recommended a technical talk today: 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAb7hSCtvGw">How to Design an a
            Good API and Why it Matters</a> by Joshua Bloch.  Looks good! It's
        also an hour long...</p>

    <p>For a variety of reasons, it's hard to watch an hour-long video.  I'd
        prefer to read the same content.  But it isn't available textually.
        For my own talks, I produce full text as part of the preparation (for
        example, <a href="/text/unipain.html">the Unicode sandwich talk</a>).</p>

    <p>I've even transcribed other peoples' PyCon talks: <a href="/blog/201206/tldw_stop_mocking_start_testing.html">Stop Mocking, Start Testing</a>,
        and <a href="/blog/201206/tldw_speedily_practical_largescale_tests.html">Speedily Practical Large-Scale Tests</a>.
        It was a good way to ensure I actually watched them!</p>

    <p>People put slide decks up on SlideShare, but decks vary wildly in how well
        they contain the content.  Some simply provide a backdrop, which is
        entertaining during a talk, but useless afterward.</p>

    <p>Is there some way we can pool efforts to get more talks transcribed or
        summarized? Surely others would like to see it done?  And there must be
        people eager to contribute in some way who could spend the time?  Does
        something like this already exist?</p>

    <p>I know the full talk, with the real speaker really speaking to me, is
        the best way to get their message. For example, Richard Feynman's
        series <a
            href="http://www.openculture.com/2012/08/the_character_of_physical_law_richard_feynmans_legendary_lecture_series_at_cornell_1964.html">The
            Character of Physical Law</a> just wouldn't be the same without his
        accent and delivery.  But if the choice is reading a lengthy summary or
        not getting the message at all, I'll definitely take the summary.</p>

    <p>Or maybe I'm an old codger stuck in text-world while all the younguns
        just want video?</p>
