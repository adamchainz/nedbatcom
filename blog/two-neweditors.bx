<title>Two new editors</title>
<category>ide</category>
<body>
<p>I spend much of my day working in a text editor, so I'm pretty sensitive to
how well it does (or doesn't) work.  I'm always on the lookout for new entrants
into the field, hoping for the perfect Windows programmer's editor.
</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I've used (and paid for) a number of editors that
came close, but which ultimately disappointed in some way, most recently
<a href='http://zeusedit.com'>Zeus</a>,
<a href='http://editpadpro.com'>EditPad Pro</a>, and
<a href='http://textpad.com'>TextPad</a>.
There are also a dozen more that I've downloaded and played with enough to see
that they weren't for me:
<a href='http://www.alleycode.com/'>Alleycode</a>,
<a href='http://www.boxersoftware.com/pgbwin.htm'>Boxer</a>,
<a href='http://www.context.cx/'>ConTEXT</a>,
<a href='http://cream.sf.net'>Cream</a>,
<a href='http://www.crimsoneditor.com/'>Crimson Editor</a>,
<a href='http://www.e-texteditor.com/'>e</a>,
<a href='http://editplus.com'>EditPlus</a>,
<a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/'>Emacs</a>,
<a href='http://www.emeditor.com/'>EmEditor</a>,
<a href='http://www.jedsoft.org/jed/'>Jed</a>,
<a href='http://jedit.org'>jEdit</a>,
<a href='http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net'>Notepad++</a>,
<a href='http://pspad.com'>PSPad</a>,
<a href='http://slickedit.com'>Slickedit</a>,
<a href='http://wiki.woodpecker.org.cn/moin/UliPad'>UliPad</a>,
<a href='http://ultraedit.com'>Ultra-Edit</a>,
<a href='http://vim.org'>vim</a>,
<a href='http://www.xtort.net/xtort/xint.php'>Xint</a>.
</p>

<p>In the past month, two new possibilities have appeared:</p>

<p><a href='http://intype.info/'><img src='pix/intype_icon.png' class='floatimg' alt='Intype'/></a>
<a href='http://intype.info/'>Intype</a> is a new editor modelled after
the much-vaunted TextMate.  They are only just getting started, but as an example
of how much they are following the TextMate model, they've implemented bundles
before most other things you need in an editor (tabbed interface, undo, etc).
</p>

<p>Although Intype has a long way to go to be a complete editor, the first looks
are promising: it is polished and thoughtful, and the team is conducting itself
in the modern way (screencasts, forums, releasing often, etc).  And the interest
is quite intense: someone has written a project manager for Intype which hijacks
Intype editor windows to present the tabbed interface Intype hasn't built yet!</p>

<p>Overall Intype is very interesting, and I'll be watching its progress.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_edit/'><img src='pix/komodo_icon.png' class='floatimg' alt='Komodo Edit'/></a>
<a href='http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_edit/'>Komodo Edit</a>
is a free subset of Komodo IDE.  For my tastes, it chooses almost the exact right subset
of features.  For example, it doesn't include Subversion integration, but I use
svn from the command line anyway.  It gets projects right: a directory spec, with file patterns
to include and exclude dynamically.  If the Find In Files features could search
the files in a project, it would probably be perfect.</p>
