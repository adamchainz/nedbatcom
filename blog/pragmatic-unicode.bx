    <p>Last week was PyCon 2012, I had a blast as always.  I gave a talk entitled,
        <a href='text/unipain.html'>Pragmatic Unicode, or, How Do I Stop the Pain?</a>
    </p>

    <p>I chose the topic because I thought it would appeal to many Python developers,
        and because I knew all about it.  Turns out I didn't!  But it was great learning
        more details as I went.  And then I filled in a few more tidbits by chatting with
        Martin v. LÃ¶wis at PyCon.</p>

    <p>Part of the fun of this talk was finding the Unicode characters to decorate it with,
        and then building the credits slide at the end on the plane.  It's all built with
        Cog to avoid cut-and-paste nightmares.  Look at the HTML source of the actual
        presentation if you're interested in the Cog twistiness.</p>

    <p>Of course, Unicode is a much bigger topic than this, but 25 minutes is what it is.
