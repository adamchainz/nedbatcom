<p>A minor hiccup in writing unit tests is how to name the classes that contain
them.  The jUnit style of test class, which has been adopted by virtually
everyone, including Python's unittest module, is that tests are methods of a
class. The class is instantiated once for each test method, then three methods
are called: setUp, the test method, and tearDown.</p>

<p>As a result, you end up with test classes that look like this:</p>

<code lang='python'><![CDATA[
# Tests for double_it, and no, no one would write them this way...
class DoubleItTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_ten(self):
        assert double_it(10) == 20
    
    def test_twenty(self):
        assert double_it(20) == 40
]]></code>
    
<p>Here I've named the class DoubleItTests, plural.  That's because I can see
that it's a container for a number of tests.  This feels right if you think
about the class simply as a namespace for the test methods.</p>

<p>But what is instantiated from the class?  Only single tests.  In this case,
the class will be instantiated twice, once to run test_ten, and once to run
test_twenty.  The class' name should really be the name of the objects.  No one
would name their user class Users under the theory that the class encompasses
a number of users.</p>

<p>So the test class should really be called DoubleItTest, which I guess fits
in with the unittest.TestCase base class it derives from.  But somehow it just
looks wrong.</p>

<p>This is reminiscent of the
<a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/338156/table-naming-dilemma-singular-vs-plural-names'>SQL table naming dilemma</a>.
Is it the CUSTOMER table, or the CUSTOMERS table? How you feel about it seems to
come down to whether you think natively in SQL, or whether it's just a backing
store for your ORM.</p> 

<p>I'm getting used to the singular test class name, but it still doesn't come
naturally, I have to remind myself to leave off those tempting plurals.</p>
