<p><a href='http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/'>The Conversations Network</a> looks like a good thing.
Doug Kaye, the founder of <a href='http://itconversations.com'>IT Conversations</a> has branched out.
IT Conversations always did a good job putting up audio from tech conferences.  Now The Conversations
Network is expanding on that idea to distribute informational audio content from a broader range of
disciplines.  Listening is free, but a paid membership will get you a listening queue, recommendations,
and write access to their forums.
