<p>Grig Gheorghiu blogs about <a href='http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/'>Agile Testing</a>,
mostly concerning Python technologies.  He has a wiki page where he tries to make sense of Python testing tools:
<a href='http://www.pycheesecake.org/wiki/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy'>Python Testing Tools Taxonomy</a>.</p>

<p>I added a link to <a href='http://jester.sourceforge.net/'>Jester</a>, a mutation testing tool.
It makes changes to your source code, then runs your test suite on the result.  If all the tests pass,
you missed a test case.  Jester works on Java code, but a sidecar tool called Pester provides the same
service for Python.
It's a fascinating idea, but I've never had the fortitude to try it out (it needs
Java and Python, and modified versions of unit test frameworks in both languages).

<p>BTW, my adding that link to that wiki page proves that I
<a href='blog/200511.html#e20051114T204716'>don't always have to control the data</a>.
