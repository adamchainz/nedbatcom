<p>The latest Coverage.py release:
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage/4.3">Coverage.py 4.3</a> is
    ready.</p>

<p>This version adds --skip-covered support to the HTML report, implements
    sys.excepthook support, reads configuration from tox.ini, and contains
    improvements that close 18 issues.  The <a href='https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/src/tip/CHANGES.rst'>complete
    change history</a> is in the source.</p>

<p>A special shout-out to <a href="http://dachary.org/">Lo√Øc Dachary</a>: he
    read my blog post about <a href='/blog/201612/who_tests_what.html'>Who Tests What</a>,
    and got interested in contributing.  And I mean, really interested.
    Suddenly he seemed to be everywhere, making pull requests and commenting on
    issues. In a week, I had 122 emails due to his activity.  That energy
    really helped push me along, and is a big reason why this release happened,
    five months after 4.2.</p>

<p>Random trivia: this is the 30th version on PyPI; it's the 57th if you
    include pre-releases.</p>
