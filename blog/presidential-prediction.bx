<title>Presidential prediction</title>
<category>politics</category>
<body>
<p>It's still 11 months until the presidential election, and we haven't had
a primary or caucus yet, but I'm willing to make a prediction: the Republican
nominee will win.
</p>

<p>I have two reasons.  First, all the likely Democrat nominees are senators,
and the likely Republican nominees are either governors or mayors.  Historically,
executive branch candidates do much better than those from the legislative branch.

<p>Contemporary electoral success has favored state governors. Of the last five

<p>Maybe this is because of the compromise nature of the legislative process, and
the hay that can be made of it. Remember "He voted for the war before he voted against the war"?
Maybe it's that personalities that succeed in Congress are not well-suited to
executive branch work.  I don't know.
</p>

<p>The second reason is that both parties have moved to the left.  Clinton and
Obama are both more liberal than Kerry was, and neither Romney or Giuliani is as
conservative as Bush was.  That means that the Republicans are moving toward the
center at the same time that the Democrats are moving away from it.  I've heard
more than one liberal Massachusetts friend say that Giuliani wouldn't be bad,
for example.</p>

<p>I hope I am wrong, but from this (admittedly early) vantage point, it doesn't
look good for Democrats.</p>
