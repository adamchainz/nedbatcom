    <p>This Wednesday the 20th, I'm speaking at the Boston Python Meetup: 
        <a href='http://meetup.bostonpython.com/events/23388681/'>Getting Started Testing your Python</a>.
        Please do come if you're in town.
        My goal will be to provide a totally from-scratch introduction to how to test Python code,
        in two hours, with time for questions.</p>

    <p>I think I may have too much to say, though.  The presentation itself is 
        <a href='/text/starttest.html'>available for review</a>. It could use another (hundred) pair of eyes.  
        If you have any suggestions about what I should leave out, what I need to add in, 
        what I've done completely wrong, and so on,
        let me know, either in a comment here, or in an <a href='mailto:ned@nedbatchelder.com'>email</a>.</p>

    <p>Thanks.</p>
