<p>Newsweek has an
<a href='http://www.msnbc.com/modules/newsweek/autism_quotient/default.asp'>Autism quotient test</a>.
Answer 50 questions to see where you land on the autism spectrum.
I scored 23 (just a tad too high for the average category).
My wife Sue scored 15 (average for women).  My autistic son scored 43 (quite high).
</p>

<p>Of course, this test is for typical people, to measure their slight differences
in position on the scale.
The irony is that some questions just won't even apply to severe autistics.
For example, "I find it easy to remember phone numbers" is
obviously trying to get at someone's attention to detail and facility with numbers.
Answering "agree" to that should put you higher up the scale.  But if a kid has
never tried to memorize phone numbers, or has difficulty with it because of their
limited language, how would they answer, and how would that affect their score?
