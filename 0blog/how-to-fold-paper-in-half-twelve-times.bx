<p>Yesterday my brother challenged us to fold a piece of paper in half
eight times, claiming it couldn't be done, and we could not.
We tried tissue paper, we tried large newsprint, but seven folds was all
we could manage.  I remembered a recent story about a high school girl
who worked out the math for the problem, and managed twelve folds, by
starting with a strip of paper a mile long or something:

They don't give details on the paper used, and the photo of the eleventh fold
doesn't look to me like she'll manage a twelfth with it, but she exceeded eight for sure.
