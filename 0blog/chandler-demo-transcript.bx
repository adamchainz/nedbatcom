<p>A <a href='http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Main/DemoTranscript2003-04-23'>transcript
of the ETCON demo of Chandler</a>
is up on the OSAF wiki, and it's good to get some context for the 0.1 release
that's been released.  I know I didn't understand what I was looking at with
Chandler, and the text of the demo helped me get it,
although there's still parts where Andy did something,
and I don't know how to do it.</p>

<p>While on the topic of trans-Outlook PIMs (that is, PIMs that go beyond Outlook),
here are a few more worth keeping an eye on:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://haystack.lcs.mit.edu/'>Haystack</a>, "the universal information client" from MIT.</li>

<li><a href='http://guests.evectors.it/zoe/'>Zo&#x00EB;</a>, "does for email what Google did for the web".</li>

<li><a href='http://www.dynamicobjects.com/index.html'>dynamicobject spaces</a>,
"a tool that will integrate seamlessly all information management tasks for individuals and small groups under a single, easy-to-use interface".</li>

</ul>
