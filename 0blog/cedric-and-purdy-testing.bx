<p><a href='http://freeroller.net/page/cbeust'>Cedric</a> and
<a href='http://freeroller.net/page/cpurdy'>Cameron</a> are having a micro-debate about the
root cause of lousy software.
Cedric <a href='http://www.freeroller.net/page/cbeust/20021128'>says</a>:
</p>

<quotep>The reason for lousy software lies in two simple words:
Inadequate testing.</quotep>

<p>In response, Cameron <a href='http://freeroller.net/page/cpurdy/20021128'>says</a>:
</p>

<quotep>If he's talking about QA, then he's dead wrong.
According to studies in all other facets of production,
a focus on increasing the quantity of QA will actually increase the number of defects.
</quotep>

<p>Now Cameron is a smart guy, so I hope he mispoke and meant
"increase the number of <i>identified</i> defects".
The software is what it is.  Increased testing cannot in and of itself increase the
number of bugs in a piece of software.</p>

<p>I think these guys are actually in agreement.  Cameron goes on to say that developers
should do more testing themselves.  Whatever.  The more testing that gets done, the more
is known about the software.  The first step to making good software is to understand
the software.
Testing is not a perfect way to know what software does, but it's the best way we've got.
