<p>I was doing some online shopping, and had to enter a credit card number.
I entered my credit card number
(using <a href='blog/200204.html#20020407T111438'>virtual card numbers</a>, of course).
I hit submit, and was prompted to enter a valid credit card number.
Of course, what had happened was that I had entered my number with spaces
between every four digits, as any normal person would do, and the stupid
site would only accept the number with no spaces in it.
</p>

<p>Why is this so hard? How many people a day get that idiotic message box?
Looking at the source for the page, I found these snippets of JavaScript:
</p>

<code lang='javascript'><![CDATA[
var cardPattern = /\d{16}/;

if (!(cardPattern.test(document.userInfo.cardNumber.value))) {
  errorMsg += 'Please enter a valid Card Number.\n';
  errorFlg = 1;
}]]></code>

<p>Why not do this:</p>

<code lang='javascript'><![CDATA[
var cardPattern = /\d{16}|\d{4} \d{4} \d{4} \d{4}/
]]></code>

<p>and let me be?  Why after all these years are average users still expected to
pick up the slack for lazy programmers?</p>

<p>And don't tell me, "the back end wouldn't accept the string with spaces, so the
front end is right to reject it"!  Why can't the back end deal with the spaces?</p>
