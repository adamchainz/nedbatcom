+ RSS feed.
    + Get the datetime correct.  New and old differ in a few details.
+ Copy new avatars.
- Sitemap.
    - Human-readable
    - XML: http://sitemaps.org
- mailto: links? In text, and in sidebar..
+ Settable base url.
+ Print.css styling.
+ Main to pull files.
    + All in-mem for speed? No: not faster!
    + What about all the verbatim stuff?
        + .htaccess
        + php.ini? (comes from reactor)
    + Unified process (makehtml.py)
+ redirects for old pages
    + old more pages.
    + How: http://annevankesteren.nl/2005/01/permanent-redirect
    + How: http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.header.php#78470
+ Nothing works unless structure.xml exists, from the old process.
+ Home page.
    - geo stuff on home page. (per-page meta tags)
- Error handling in loadpages when a bad tag is used? (etc..)
+ generator.py needs to indicate when a page results in an error.
+ err404.php has to be created. (as err404.html)
+ WHOA is busted.

+ rsync to tch? No.
- Other way to move bulk pages?
    - ftp a tarball?

URL Mapping
+ Must still work:
    blog/200404.html#e20040425T124541
    blog/20071216T110049.html
    blog/tag_politics.html
    code/modules/hyphenate.py
    blog/rssfull.xml --> blog/rss.xml
    
Later:
- Atom feed?
- Related tags (later).
- Next and prev links on individual blog entries? (later)
+ Use a manager to enforce Entry.filter(draft=False)
    - Or just don't put them in the db to begin with!
- Ads?
- Redirect to non-.html files. (blog/index.html --> blog/)
+ Page lang=en attribute.
+ TPT
+ create nedbatchelder.js from the three source files.

Done:
+ Blog main page.
+ Tag pages.
+ Comment form.
+ pix aren't found in current directory structure.
+ Better slugs: too long, and russian comes out as ____.html
+ Sidebars.
    + For articles.
    + Blogroll.
    + Make it includable.
    + Generate the includable file.
    + Double-check that there was no wacko page with a different sidebar.
+ Breadcrumbs.
